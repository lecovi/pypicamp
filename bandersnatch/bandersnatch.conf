[mirror]
# The mirror directory setting is a string that specifies the directory to store the mirror files.
# 
# The directory used must meet the following requirements:
# 
#     The filesystem must be case-sensitive filesystem.
#     The filesystem must support large numbers of sub-directories.
#     The filesystem must support large numbers of files (inodes)
directory = /data/pypi/mirror

# Filesystem Support
# This is the default mode for bandersnatch.
storage-backend = filesystem

# Optional index hashing to store simple HTML in directories
# Recommended as PyPI has a lot of packages these days
# hash-index = true

# The mirror json seting is a boolean (true/false) setting that indicates that the json packaging metadata should be mirrored in additon to the packages.
json = true

# The mirror release-files setting is a boolean (true/false) setting that indicates that the package release files should be mirrored. Defaults to true. When this option is disabled (via setting to false), you should also specify the root_uri configuration. If the uri is empty, it will be set to https://files.pythonhosted.org/.
release-files = true

# The master setting is a string containing a url of the server which will be mirrored.
# The master url string must use https: protocol.
# The default value is: https://pypi.org
master = https://pypi.org

# The timeout value is an integer that indicates the maximum number of seconds for web requests.
# The default value for this setting is 10 seconds.
timeout = 10

# The global-timeout value is an integer that indicates the maximum runtime of individual aiohttp coroutines.
# The default value for this setting is 18000 seconds, or 5 hours.
global-timeout = 18000

# The workers value is an integer from from 1-10 that indicates the number of concurrent downloads.
# The default value is 3.
# Recommendations for the workers setting:
#
#    leave the default of 3 to avoid overloading the pypi master
#    official servers located in data centers could run 10 workers
#    anything beyond 10 is probably unreasonable and is not allowed.
workers = 3

# The hash-index is a boolean (true/false) to determine if package hashing should be used.
# The Recommended setting: the default of false for full pip/pypi compatibility.
# 
# Warning
# Package index directory hashing is incompatible with pip, and so this should only be used in an environment where it is behind an application that can translate URIs to filesystem locations. 
hash-index=false

# The stop-on-error setting is a boolean (true/false) setting that indicates if bandersnatch should stop immediately if it encounters an error.
# If this setting is false it will not stop when an error is encountered but it will not mark the sync as successful when the sync is complete.
stop-on-error = false

# The log-config setting is a string containing the filename of a python logging configuration file.
# log-config = /etc/bandersnatch-log.conf

# The root_uri is a string containing a uri which is the root added to relative links.
# 
# 
# Note
#
# This is generally not necessary, but was added for the official internal PyPI mirror, which requires serving packages from https://files.pythonhosted.org 
#root_uri = https://example.com

# The diff file is a string containing the filename to log the files that were downloaded during the mirror. This file can then be used to synchronize external disks or send the files through some other mechanism to offline systems. You can then sync the list of files to an attached drive or ssh destination such as a diode:
#
# rsync -av --files-from=/srv/pypi/mirrored-files / /mnt/usb/
#
# You can also use this file list as an input to 7zip to create split archives for transfers, allowing you to size the files as you needed:
#
# 7za a -i@"/srv/pypi/mirrored-files" -spf -v100m path_to_new_zip.7z
# diff-file = /srv/pypi/mirrored-files

# The diff append epoch is a boolean (true/false) setting that indicates if the diff-file should be appended with the current epoch time. This can be used to track diffs over time so the diff file doesn’t get cobbered each run. It is only used when diff-file is used.
# diff-append-epoch = true

# The compare method is used to set how to compare an existing file with upstream file to determine whether a download is required:
#     hash: this is the default which reads local file content and computes hashes (currently sha256sum), it is reliable but sometimes slower;
#     stat: use file size and change time to compare, which is named after the stat() syscall, this avoids retrieving the full file content thus reducing some io workloads.
# compare-method = hash

# The proxy is used only when requesting master server, eg. downloading index or package file from pypi.org. The proxy value will be passed to aiohttp as proxy parameter, like aiohttp.get(link, proxy=yourproxy), check the aioproxy manual for more details: https://docs.aiohttp.org/en/stable/client_advanced.html#proxy-support
proxy=http://devpi:3141

[plugins]
# The plugins setting is a list of plugins to enable.
# Example (enable all installed filter plugins):
#     Explicitly enabling plugins is now mandatory for activating plugins
#     They will do nothing without activation
# Also, enabling will get plugin’s defaults if not configured in their respective sections.

    blocklist_project

# The blocklist / allowlist settings are in configuration sections named [blocklist] and [allowlist] these section provides settings to indicate packages, projects and releases that should / should not be mirrored from PyPI.
# This is useful to avoid syncing broken or malicious packages.
# The packages setting is a list of python pep440 version specifier of packages to not be mirrored. Enable version specifier filtering for blocklist and allowlist packages through enabling the ‘blocklist_release’ and ‘allowlist_release’ plugins, respectively.

# Any packages matching the version specifier for blocklist packages will not be downloaded. Any packages not matching the version specifier for allowlist packages will not be downloaded.
